.. Capturing with a single Parser

Capturing with a Single |Parser|
================================

This first example is a modified version of the dataset used in the first half of the
project `README <https://github.com/bskinn/pent/blob/master/README.rst>`__,
drawn from a .hess file generated by
`ORCA <https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de>`__:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> text = dedent("""\
    ... $vibrational_frequencies
    ... 6
    ... 0          0.000000
    ... 1          0.000000
    ... 2       -194.490162
    ... 3       -198.587114
    ... 4        389.931897
    ... 5        402.713910
    ... """)


A Minimal |Parser| Body
-----------------------

Focusing first on the main section of the data, the goal here is to retrieve
the floats in the right-hand column; the rest of the content is irrelevant.
However, the integers in the left-hand column still have to be represented in the
pattern, even if they're not captured.

So, to represent those leading integers, the first token of the body pattern
needs to be a single number (|cour|\ #.\ |/cour|) that's not captured
(omit |cour|\ !\ |/cour|), with a positive sign
(|cour|\ +\ |/cour|) and integer format (|cour|\ i\ |/cour|), leading to
|cour|\ #.+i\ |/cour|.

Then, to match the second, decimal value on each line, the second token
needs to also be a single number
(|cour|\ #.\ |/cour|) of decimal format (|cour|\ d\ |/cour|).
But, since we want these values to be captured in output, it's necessary to
insert |cour|\ !\ |/cour| after |cour|\ #\ |/cour|. And, since some of the values
in this list are negative and some are positive, the token should allow any
sign (|cour|\ .\ |/cour|).
Thus, the second token should be |cour|\ #!..d\ |/cour|.

So, a first stab at the body of the |Parser| would be:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs = pent.Parser(body="#.+i #!..d")
    >>> prs.capture_body(text)
    [[['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']]]

Works nicely! There are two things to note about the data returned here, though:

**First**, all of the numerical values are returned as **strings**.  ``pent`` tries to
maximize flexibility by making no assumptions about what needs to be
done with the data. Thus, some post-processing will always be required.
For example, to get the captured values from `data` into a ``numpy`` array,
one could do the following:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> arr = np.asarray(prs.capture_body(text), dtype=float).squeeze()
    >>> print(arr)
    [   0.          0.       -194.490162 -198.587114  389.931897  402.71391 ]

**Second**, the captured data is always returned as a nested series of lists.
In situations like this one, where a single |Parser| is used,
the nesting will be three levels deep. This is because each matching block
of data is returned as a matrix (a list of lists), and each of these matrices
is then in turn a member of the outermost list.

In this particular instance, since the `body` captures exactly one value
per line of test parsed, the innermost lists are length-one. And, since
there are six lines that match the `body` pattern, the matrix
that is returned is of size 6x1 (a list containing six length-one lists).

This means that if there had been a gap in the data,
the outermost list would have had length greater than one:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> text2 = dedent("""\
    ... 0      0.000000
    ... 1      0.000000
    ...
    ... 2   -194.490162
    ... 3   -198.587114
    ... """)
    >>> prs.capture_body(text2)
    [[['0.000000'], ['0.000000']], [['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114']]]

There are two blocks of data here, each with two rows of one value each, so
the return value from |capture_body| is a length-two list,
where each item of that list represents a 2x1 matrix.


Capturing Multiple Values per Line
----------------------------------

If one wanted to also capture the integer indices in each row, the only
change needed would be to add the |cour|\ !\ |/cour| capturing flag to that first token:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> pent.Parser(body="#!.+i #!..d").capture_body(text2)
    [[['0', '0.000000'], ['1', '0.000000']], [['2', '-194.490162'], ['3', '-198.587114']]]


Constraining the |Parser| Match with a `head`
---------------------------------------------

**However,** what if there are other datasets in the file that have
this same format, but that we don't want to capture:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> text3 = dedent("""\
    ... $vibrational_frequencies
    ... 6
    ... 0          0.000000
    ... 1          0.000000
    ... 2       -194.490162
    ... 3       -198.587114
    ... 4        389.931897
    ... 5        402.713910
    ...
    ... $unrelated_data
    ... 3
    ... 0          3.316
    ... 1         -4.311
    ... 2         12.120
    ... """)

The original |Parser| will grab both of these blocks of data:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs.capture_body(text3)
    [[['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']], [['3.316'], ['-4.311'], ['12.120']]]

The |Parser| can be constrained to only the data we want by introducing a `head`
pattern:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs2 = pent.Parser(
    ...     head=["@.$vibrational_frequencies", "#!.+i"],
    ...     body="#.+i #!..d"
    ... )
    >>> prs2.capture_body(text3)
    [[['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']]]

This use of `head` introduces two concepts: (1) the 'literal string' token, |cour|\ @\ |/cour|,
in combination with the "\ |cour|\ .\ |/cour|\ " quantity marker telling the
|Parser| to match the literal string exactly once; and (2) the ``pent``
feature wherein a length-\ *n* ordered iterable of pattern strings
(here, length-two) will match *n* lines from the data string. In this case,
the first string in the tuple matches the
"\ |cour|\ $vibrational_frequencies\ |/cour|\ " marker in the first line of the header,
and the second captures the single positive integer in the second line of the header.


Capturing in *head* and *tail* with |capture_struct|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the example immediately above, note that even though the "\ |cour|\ !\ |/cour|\ "
capturing flag is specified in the second element of the `head`,
that captured value does not show up in the
|capture_body| output.  Captures in `head` and `tail` must
be retrieved using |capture_struct|:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs2.capture_struct(text3)
    [{<ParserField.Head: 'head'>: [['6']], <ParserField.Body: 'body'>: [['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']], <ParserField.Tail: 'tail'>: None}]
    >>> prs2.capture_struct(text3)[0][pent.ParserField.Head]
    [['6']]

The return value from |capture_struct|
has length equal to the number of times the |Parser| matched
within the text. Here, since the pattern only matched once, the return
value is of length one.

As a convenience, the lists returned by |capture_struct|
are actually of type |ThruList|, a custom subclass of |list|,
which will silently pass through indices/keys to their first argument
if and only if they are of length one.
Thus, the following would also work for `prs2` operating on `text3`:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs2.capture_struct(text3)[pent.ParserField.Head]
    [['6']]

But, it would break for the original `prs`,
where the overall pattern matched twice:

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> prs.capture_struct(text3)
    [{<ParserField.Head: 'head'>: None, <ParserField.Body: 'body'>: [['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']], <ParserField.Tail: 'tail'>: None}, {<ParserField.Head: 'head'>: None, <ParserField.Body: 'body'>: [['3.316'], ['-4.311'], ['12.120']], <ParserField.Tail: 'tail'>: None}]
    >>> prs.capture_struct(text3)[pent.ParserField.Head]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    pent.errors.ThruListError: Invalid ThruList index: Numeric index required for len != 1

As a final note, consider the difference between the `head` and `tail` results
for the below |Parser|, where `head` is defined but has no capturing tokens present
(yields ``[[]]``), but `tail` is not specified (yields ``None``):

.. doctest:: orca_freqs

    >>> pent.Parser(head="#.+i", body="#.+i #!..d").capture_struct(text)
    [{<ParserField.Head: 'head'>: [[]], <ParserField.Body: 'body'>: [['0.000000'], ['0.000000'], ['-194.490162'], ['-198.587114'], ['389.931897'], ['402.713910']], <ParserField.Tail: 'tail'>: None}]
